Hello there, I'm Mohammad, a second year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at George Mason University. I am very lucky to be a part of [RobotiXX lab](https://people.cs.gmu.edu/~xxiao2/RobotiXX/lab.html) and working with a group of talented people. 

**Research Goal:** My research focuses on aiding mobile robots to become more aware of their surrounding and navigate autonomously with minimum human supervision. I approach this challenge by going beyond task-specific agents and designing self-supervised algorithms that learn by unifying multiple data modalities to better understand the environment.
