Hello there, I am Mohammad, a first year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at George Mason University. I am very lucky to be a part of [RobotiXX lab](https://people.cs.gmu.edu/~xxiao2/RobotiXX/lab.html) and working with a group of talented people. My research focuses on aiding mobile robots to become socially aware and navigate autonomously in crowded environments without being a hindrance. To achieve this, I work in robotics, deep learning, and computer vision.
